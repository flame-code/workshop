In this mini package we implement a neural-network (NN) method
for constructing DFT-based PESs of water (H_2O), which have 
ab-initio accuracy. 

This is achieved by combining NN precision 
and flexibility with a PES representation that is inspired by
empirical potentials.

The resulting many-body potentials are a function of all atomic coordinates and can
be used in systems of arbitrary size.

Our ANN works well in the prediction of ground state of water.
